## Skills
The portfolio includes a skills table outlining the programming languages I have experience with

## Contact
I included a form for users that wanted to contact me. The form is still built using basic html, the reason why it isn't functional as of the moment. I am expecting that it will be functional once we are on javascript. It requries the user to send their name, email, contact number, and message/s if they have concern or something they wanted me to know.

## HTML elements and tags I utilized
Brief descriptions about the elements and tags I utilized

  1. !DOCTYPE html
      - This tells the browser that the document is using HTML5.

  2. html and head
      - The html tag wraps all the content on the page. The <head> section has the important information like the character set (UTF-8), settings for mobile devices, and the title of the page. This helps the website to be
    consistent regardless of the devices used upon viewing.

  3. body
      - This is where the main content of the webpage goes, including text, images, tables, and links.

  4. header and nav
      - The header tag contains the navigation menu. The <nav> tag includes links to different sections like Home, Projects, Skills, and Contact. This helps the user to navigate to the page they wanted to explore.
  
  5. a (Anchor tag)
      - This creates clickable links to other sections of the page or external sites, such as GitHub for each project.
  
  6. ul (Unordered list)
      - This was normally utilized on navigation bars, but since we are still not allowed to use CSS, i only used it to enlist the projects I've done using different programming languages.
  
  7. img (Image tag)
      - This displays images like project visuals and logos. It uses attributes to specify where the image is from, its size, and what happens when you hover over it.
  
  8. h1, h2, h3, h4
      - These are header tags used for titles and subtitles. h1 is for main section titles like Projects, Skills, and Contact. h2 and h3 are for project titles and subheadings.
  
  9. font (Deprecated tag)
      - This tag styles text by setting the font, color, and size. The reason why there was too much codings to begin with. We aren't allowed to use CSS as of the moment so I needed to utilize it as much as I could.
  
  10. table, th, tr, td
      - These are used to show data in a table format. Normally, it's only used to display data in a table, but since I needed to utilize the html emlements and tags only, I also used it to format the images, 
  text, and even forms for them to be alligned as how I like it. They helped me display projects and skills properly. <th> defines the table headers, <tr> defines table rows, and <td> defines table cells.
  
  11. br (Line break)
      - This adds space between elements by creating a line break.
  
  12. hr (Horizontal rule)
      - This creates a horizontal line to separate different sections of the page.
  
  13. input (Form input)
      - This is used in the contact form to collect information like name, contact number, email, and message. Different types include text, telephone, email, and submit buttons.
  
  14. label
      - This describes the input fields in the contact form, making it easier for users to know what to fill in.
  
  15. footer
      - This contains the footer part of the page, showing copyright information and links to external profiles like GitHub.
